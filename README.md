# CFG-python
As part of the Code First Girls introductory course to Python, me and my team created a program that searches for recipes based on an ingredient using the Edamam API.

We wished to create a search function that allows the user to enter multiple ingredients that they have left straying in their fridge and cupboards and try to put them to use! As we know calories are quite personal, we offered the option to choose whether you'd like to see them.

Upon entering ingredients the program creates a text file with all the resulting recipes and a link, to make it easily accessible. For those that chose to see the calories of each recipe we also returned an ordered list so they were able to see what recipe would be the least or most calorific.
